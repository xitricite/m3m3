. . . . .
A terriblly cheesy plot that ends horribly, starring a good sport: my friend.

Not really...
- Tracking: tracking markers were used on a green-screen, they were kinda hard to track because of the plate's low resolution compared to the size of the markers (printed too small oops).
- Masking: there was a green screen with stuff around it garbaged masked out, but not much.
