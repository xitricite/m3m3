Mid 2015 – End of 2017, Association of Malaysian Students (AMS)

Working wih the team, Khai, Afiq, ZZ, Ben, Amber, Stevis, Sufi, Amira... (this year there wasn't many people, more people who joined!) I was the graphics gal.
  - Created striking visual designs, including promotional event posters and online content, to encourage students to experience a bit of Malaysian culture (such as Mamak Night).
  - Redeveloped the visual identity of AMS through collaboration with fellow committee and club members. Which ensured that I delivered to the creative brief and received positive feedback from club members.
  - Used Indesign’s Data Merge to create batches of individual committee business cards quickly and consistently
