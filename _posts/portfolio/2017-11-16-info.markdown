Web layout of an infogrpahic, for a unit in Visualisation Technologies.

###Process
- Data sources picked from various sources as CSV's, or more horrifyingly just plain pictures. Tables weren't too bad... &#x1F602;
- Converted into a JSON array (looks like [1, 2, 3]) with an [online tool](http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm)
- Placed into a Codepen with [Chart.js](www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) loaded from a CDN
- Then
- (Waypoints.js](imakewebthings.com/waypoints/) documenation was a bit too nice and simple, so I did struggle with that initially  &#x1F914; (had some issues on finding out how to bind scroll events...)
