I've given up on Jekyll and Liquid and all that. This website was such a challenge and such a leap from wordpress PHP devleopment.

This website is best viewed on Chrome ~Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)~ as of build date :b.


##Wireframe Sketches
I thought to intergrate the contact page here and have #ID link just jump to that section (like clicking on Wikipediaâ€™s index links). Having to take a self portrait seems a bit troublesome, so #2 has a placeholder image of cartoon trenchcoat cats. Love it. #4 has a massive silouette of WA in the background, though it may get a bit too distracting?
