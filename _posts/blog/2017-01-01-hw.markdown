AHH Jekyll, the flat site generator with Liquid templating and all that. This website was such a challenge (such a leap from wordpress PHP devleopment) yet it's here online. The world sure is great.


### Coding
`Note: This website is best viewed on Chrome ~Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)~ as of build date :b.`


### Wireframe Sketches
I thought to intergrate the contact page here and have #ID link just jump to that section (like clicking on Wikipediaâ€™s index links). Having to take a self portrait seems a bit troublesome, so #2 has a placeholder image of cartoon trenchcoat cats. Love it. #4 has a massive silouette of WA in the background, though it may get a bit too distracting?
